# An Analysis of Crime and Incarceration in the United States

Data set contained the number of incarcerated and crime commited broken out by type for years 2001-2016 by state. State population was also given which allowed for an analysis of the rates with population. 
See below for analysis performed with the data.

## Trend Analysis- crime Rate vs Incarceration Rate

Narrowed down analysis to the top populated states by taking total state population for each year. Result: California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania.

Calculated the crime rate and incarceration rate per state. Compared results in a scatter plot with marker size indicating year. (smallest being 2001 and largest being 2016)
Ploted results in line graphs by state. The ideal outcome would imply that crime rate should go down over time as incarceration rate increases. However, the results showed no correlation. 
Florida was the only state that exhibited trends that fit this assumption. For Texas, you see both crime rate and incarceration rate decrease. 

Type of crime was broken out by violent and property crime. The same analysis from above was repeated for the property crime rate. The results were similar to the above analysis.

## Crime Rate by State

Ploted the average crime rate by state for years 2012-2016, 2007-2011, and 2002-2006. Visualized results in a series of chloropleth maps. These graphs show that overall crime rate has decreased and more crimes occured in Southern states compared to the Northern states. 

## Type of Crime

Totaled each violent crime by type over all years. (murder, rape, robbery, assault) Assault was the top violent crime committed. The highest number of crimes occured in Florida. 

## Nationwide 

The nationwide analysis took the total crime commited by state. As total population has increased, crime has decreased over time. 
Property crime has decreased while crime rate has decreased.
